Derivatives folder contains fully preprocessed fMRI data for each subject. The following preprocessing steps were carried out:
- Time shifting
- Despiking
- Volume Registration
- Alignment to MNI template
- Mask timeseries
- Smoothing 6mm FWHM
- Detrending with 6 regressors (eg. motion)
- Timing correction (to account for pauses in scanning)
- Concatenation of runs
- ICA manual artifact removal 

The 1D file in the func directories contains ICA (independent component analysis) artifactual timecourses.

The motion directory contains motion estimates are from the registration procedure in the AFNI program ‘3dvolreg’ and outliers were estimated using ‘3dToutcount’.
These are provided in space-delimited text files where the estimates represent:
- motion: degree of roll, pitch and yaw and displacement in the superior (dS), left (dL) and posterior (dP) directions in mm; 2) 
- maxdisp_delt: maximum displacement (delta) between any two consecutive timepoints
- wm: mean activity in the white matter
- ventricle: mean activity in the ventricles
- outliers: individual timepoint outliers at 10% levels.
