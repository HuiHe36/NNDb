Motion estimates are from the registration procedure in the AFNI program ‘3dvolreg’ and outliers were estimated using ‘3dToutcount’, These are provided in space-delimited text files where the estimates represent 1) motion: degree of roll, pitch and yaw and displacement in the superior (dS), left (dL) and posterior (dP) directions in mm; 2) maxdisp_delt: maximum displacement (delta) between any two consecutive timepoints; 3) wm: mean activity in the white matter; 4) ventricle: mean activity in the ventricles and 5) outliers: individual timepoint outliers at 10% levels.
